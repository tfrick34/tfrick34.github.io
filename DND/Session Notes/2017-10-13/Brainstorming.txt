- Come up with random encounter list.
- Figure out where the old guard are headquartered based on map.


______________________________________________________________________________
**** Pre-session
	-- I'm going to start resolving some rolls myself.


(((TRIGGERS)))



**** Transition
	*** Say to group:
	-- The town has mostly returned to normal.  The uprising in the lower district has calmed. Relations between the Heart Gaurd and the poor have been mended and most of the poor have willingly handed over their weapons.
	-- The general public has mixed feelings about the group, although a slight majority is positive. The upper district is generally upset about the happenings over the last couple of months.
	-- Ronald Harsh has been appointed special Chancelor and has yet to yield the power. 
	-- You reunite with eachother during the height of All Spirits Festival.


**** All Spirits Festival
	-- Last full moon that falls on xx for the year.
	-- Celebration of all spirits, good and evil.
	-- Spirits are known to visit the population during this time.
	-- Particularly popular this year due to actual devils and vampires in town.
	-- Citizens dress and spirits (devils, demons, vampires, ghosts.)
	-- Slavers use this event in attempts to assassinate the group.
	-- A ghost (Henryetta Mason) who was assinated by the slavers wants Horros Screamskull killed.  Will actively kill assassins and slavers.


**** Church of the Light
	-- Want Balto to participate in their Cleansed by Light ritual.  
		~ Takes a full day.
		~ If completed: Balto gains "of the Light" title, given "Blind Faith"
			= +2 AC. If this shield is equipped when the bearer is blinded, they get +2 AC and attacks against them do not have advantage.



**** Slavers of Heartland City.
	((The Heartland City HQ for the slavers is right on the outskirts of town.))
	((It's not exactly well gaurded considering the slavers haven't had much resistance in the region.))
	((If the players go at night there is no gaurd and everyone is asleep.))

	-- GETTING THERE.
		~ Players can basically ask anyone where the slavers HQ is.
			= Commoners will say "it's about that way."
			= Guard will give you an exact location.

	-- Members:
		~ (Transaction Coordinator) Peter Griffon
			= Slaver Captain

		~ (Heartland City Overseer) Horros Screamskull
			= Level X X

		~ (Assistant) Pyth (pi-th) Luwin
			= Commoner. 
			= Former Accountant.

		~ Tubs
			= Slaver Captain (Modified, double HP)

		~ Two Thugs

	-- COMBAT
		~ Once combat starts, Peter orders a slaver captain to run off. If he succesfully gets away, Ronald Harsh is notified that the group eliminated the slavers.
		~ During combat, tubs will call in backup every round as long as he's conscious to sound the horn.


**** Uniting the Guard.
	((Players cannot get a meeting with the Dragonclaw until they rid Heartland City of the Slavers of Heartland City))
	-- The Guard has been split to "The Old Guard" and "The Guard".
		~ The Old Guard is made up of former members of The Guard.  They still stand to protect the realm, but no longer recognize the legitimacy of the current king.
			= Made up of about two thousand members.
			= Leader is General Cameron Dragonclaw.
		~ The Guard are still loyal to the King. Most members recognize that the king does not have the kingdom's best interest at heart but are bound to duty by their honor.


**** No-Mans-Land
	((If the team goes southwest, northwest past Pangold's Peak, or west (off the road)))
	((This is a wild life preserve for dinosaurs.))
	((It's run and protected by Durian.))
	((Total area: 15 sq miles))

		-- As the players approach, they see a well-maintained solid wooden fence.
			~ The fence is built out of solid trunks an average of fifteen feet high.
			~ There is no gate in sight.

		-- Inside:
			1x Tyrannosaurus Rex
			3x Triceratops
			2x Allosaurus
			5x Ankylosaurus
			3x Quetzalcoatlus
			1x Plesiosaurus
			10x Pteranodon

		-- Once in, they are immediately approached by a very large man, describe him:

			"You are approached by a seemingly larger-than-life man.  He is well over eight feet tall with the wingspan of a Giant Eagle. The party is immediately mesmorized by his magnificant beard. Distracted by said beard, the party almost doesn't notice his massive Greataxe."

		-- Durian asks the group these questions:

			1. Have you ever killed a beast. (Why)
			2. Have you ever saved a beast. (Why)
			3. What is man's purpose.

		-- If the team passes this test, they are welcomed to his land.  If not, they are attacked.


**** Property Value
	((Bernard is a slaver sympathizer.  He is run by greed and gets a fair wage from the organization.))

	-- Coloneous is summoned by Bernard Yuppington III, a city magistrate who oversees real estate.  He has been tipped off by Frederick Foyer.
	-- Coloneous is given a choice, either pay 10k gold plus monthly land taxes or do a "small favor." Kill Melvin Atwater.
	-- For the favor, say:
		"I've heard of your strength and heroism;  and I don't care much about the latter.  I need a small favor and you can call this farm yours. There is a certain Magistrate I want to 'go away.'"


**** Join or Help
