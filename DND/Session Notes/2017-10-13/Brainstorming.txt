(((TRIGGERS)))



**** Transition
	*** Say to group:
	-- The town has mostly returned to normal.  The uprising in the lower district has calmed. Relations between the Heart Gaurd and the poor have been mended and most of the poor have willingly handed over their weapons.
	-- The general public has mixed feelings about the group, although a slight majority is positive. The upper district is generally upset about the happenings over the last couple of months.
	-- Ronald Harsh has been appointed special Chancelor and has yet to yield the power. 



**** Church of the Light
	-- Want Balto to participate in their Cleansed by Light ritual.  
		~ Takes a full day.
		~ If completed: Balto gains "of the Light" title, given "Blind Faith"
			= +2 AC. If this shield is equipped when the bearer is blinded, they get +2 AC and attacks against them do not have advantage.
