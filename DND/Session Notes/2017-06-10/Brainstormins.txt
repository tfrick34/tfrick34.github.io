Open with talking about PC deaths and "taking off the gloves".

Resolve Downtimes

Possibly make new shit for guilds


Talk about heartland:
	 You can tell the citizens live in constant fear and morale is very low.  Walking the streets, no one really makes eye contact with eachother, and there is no friendly banter or much talking at all.  Markets are very empty and the common area sees no one carousing. It's rare to find a gaurd unless you're in the Aorta district or possible the Atrium. No one seems very willing to help.  Perhaps making someone feel safe in their own home could help your situation.


Session goal: rid Heartland City of the vampires plaguing the city.
	Exclaim that whenever you do talk to a citizen, they make it very clear not to go out at night.  
	The streets are barren at night.
	There is a vampire hunter actively attempting to rid the city of the plague: Malaraan Silverhand
		Malaraan knows of two vampire's previous lives.
		Malaraan knows of Duncan.
		Malaraan knows where they are coming from (the crypt)
		Malaraan knows an ancient technique to turn a "new" vampire back - has never attempted.


Assassin attack.
	Try poisen at tavern or inn.
	Two assassins attack group.

Possibly track down slavers HQ and kill management.


Towards the end, attempt to guide  them to the siege.  Use the old gaurd.
