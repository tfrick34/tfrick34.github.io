	-- Next time the group goes more than a days walk from Heartland they cross No-Mans-Land.



**** Transition
	*** Say to group:
		- The lower district is in open revolt.
		- There have been no changes in the weather pattern.  This is becoming more uncharacteristic of the region each day as the summer is coming to an end and autumn is approaching.
		- Birdperson is feeling uncomfortable about the general population's attitude towards him.
		- Ultros has a meeting scheduled with The Scorched Page today.
		- Before Coloneous last leaves his farm he is approached by the tax collector Frederick Foyer.

		~ Coloneous can avoid the extensive land and farm taxes by paying him one thousand gold a month.

**** The lower district.
	((Investigation into Mansoon is progressing.))
	((From the previous incident in the lower district where Mansoon was seen, Birdperson is now a person of interest.))

	-- The Gaurd have pulled out of the district. They setup road blocks on all of the entrances to the district.

	-- The revolt has designated a leader in Mansoon's abscence: Henry Smithe.





**** The Scored Page Meets.

	-- Henry Foresight questions how we know Mansoon is truely responsible and attempts to cast doubts on Ronald's character.





**** Slavers of Heartland City.
	((The Heartland City HQ for the slavers is right on the outskirts of town.))

**** Meeting with Melvin.
	((Melvin is less likely to help based on last session's interaction))
	((Melvin is also a little suspicious of Utlros based on the investigation into Mansoon.))

		-- Melvin has info on the Orcish Horde
			((There is currently no reward for killing the Giant))
				~ A frost Giant is taking up residence in Pangold's Heights mountains for the upcoming winter.
				~ He has gained control of the horde and was attempting to use them to take the keep and surrounding territory.
				~ The horde is no longer a threat, but the Giant may be.

		-- Melvin offers an agreement based on advice from Peter. Turn in Mansoon and he'll help with election of Ronald.
