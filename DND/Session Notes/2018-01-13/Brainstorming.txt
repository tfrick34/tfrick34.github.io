**** BACK STORY FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO HEARTLAND.

		-- Ronald Harshe was assinated.
			((By the Old Guard.))

		-- The assassin got away with help from a riot that was simultaneously started.

		((Since Ronald Harshe was aligned with the King's evil deeds, the King was outraged by the assassination and decided to punish the city with Gryldrog.))

		--  Gryldrog attacked the city unconditionally and relentlessly. 

		((The King is also aligned with the slavers.  The slavers are his secret militia that he uses to carry out his evil deeds.))

		((Killing any of the heads of the slavers will trigger another Gryldrog attack.))

**** TRANSITION
		
		Read:

			A couple days have passed and the team is still camping out at the manner. You notice that the sun is shining ever so slightly brighter through overgrown foliage each day.  You see less shadowy figures looming in the shadows and you get the sense that the "shadowlands" are losing their "shadow."  Making it... just.. "lands."

		-- The team has a less of a chance to run into random encounters.




**** RETURNING TO HEARTLAND

		Read:

			The majority of the journey back to Heartland City goes by virtually uninterupted.  Eventually, you make it back to the ((ROAD BETWEEN HEARTLAND AND FREE HARBOR)). You notice an increased frequency in slaver caravans.  Oddly enough, you realize that they are only going west towards Free Harbor.  One such group of slavers, battered and injured, are hauling an equally injured cargo. You decide to stop.

			-- Slavers are injured from the Dragon attack on Heartland.
			-- Slavers openly give information due to pure shock of the happenings of the last couple of days.
			-- The Slavers know:
				~~ Ronald Harshe was assassinated by a dagger wielding assassin during a speech.
				~~ The next day an Ancient ((BLACK)) Dragon attacked the city, 
				~~ Many are fleeing the city.
				~~ The Old Guard are exploiting the chaos of the situation to assassinate slavers.




**** RE-ENTERING HEARTLAND.
		
		Read:

			Reaching the outskirts of Heartland you immediately notice it to be more bustling than you remember. Looking around you see rich amongst the poor and Guard amongst the Slavers. Most noticebly, however you notice the chaos of it all.

			-- There are small camps setup for injured. Most injuries are acid related.
			-- Inside the city, there is severe structural damage everywhere.

			-- The team re-meets Mathew (the poor traveling merchant)



**** Uniting the Guard.
		((The Old Guard know of the players and do not trust them since they are semi-aligned with the Slavers.))

			-- The Guard has been split to "The Old Guard" and "The Guard".
				~~ The Old Guard is made up of former members of The Guard.  They still stand to protect the realm, but no longer recognize the legitimacy of the current king.
					== Made up of about two thousand members.
					== Leader is General Cameron Dragonclaw.
				~~ The Guard are still loyal to the King. Most members recognize that the king does not have the kingdom's best interest at heart but are bound to duty by their honor.

			-- The team must do something to gain the attention of the Old Guard in order to gain a meeting with the Dragonclaw.
				~~ Kill slavers, help the people, defeat Gryldrog, etc.

			-- If the team gains a meeting the Dragonclaw, he expresses his displeasure with the group.
				~~ He asks them if they remember why they're here.  Once answered, he asks them what they've done to help Light's Perch.
				~~ To redeem themselves, he wants them to kill Horros Screamskull.
