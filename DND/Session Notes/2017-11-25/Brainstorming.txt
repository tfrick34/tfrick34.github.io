**** Shadow lands (Huntsville)
		-- The group happens upon Huntsville. Read:
			~ The town is quaint and welcoming. You see friendly faces working their fields and you can smell the sweet smell of onions cooking in preperation for dinner. Looking over the town, it is well-kept and clean.  The dirt roads are neatly lined with stone, fences are void of imperfections, and roofs have fresh thatch.
		-- The group is welcomed at the Butcher (1) by Heager (Hey-ger) read:
			~ Approaching you is a sturdy, well-built man.  The man is covered in blood, mostly on his apron, but his demeanor is welcoming.  Wiping his hands with a towel, he welcomes you to Huntsville.


		1: The Butcher.

			~ On fail, the entire floor gives out and the group is dropped to a pit below.
			~ On success, the doors in the foyer unlock.


**** Free Harbor.
	-- The outskirts of freeharbor are dirty, grungy, and run-down.  People live in un-kept, broken down houses or in makeshift tents.
	-- Slavers walk free, openly doing as they please throughout town.
	-- Thugs often cause trouble with the "outsiders"
	-- Once the group has made enough noise, they are approached by Hros the Lifetaker (Champion, volo's page 212)
