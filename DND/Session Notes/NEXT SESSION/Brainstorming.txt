	PLAYERS ARE STARTING AT THE KEEP

		TODO:
			- There needs to be reconciliation between the group and the Old Gaurd.
				~ The Dragonclaw is greatly displeased with the group.
				~ Prove themselves?
					-- Fight the black dragon?
					-- Kill more slavers?
					-- Renegotiate?


 **** DRAGONCLAW'S PLAN

 		-- What does he want to do with the group?

 			- Prison Escape?
 			- Captured to fight the Dragon?

 			**** POSSIBLE SCENARIO

 				- Group is captured unconditionally with a large force.
 				- They meet up with the Dragonclaw and armed gaurds.
 				- Dragonclaw gives them an ultimatum - Kill the black dragon or Balto is executed and they are exiled from the kingdom.


 **** BLACK DRAGON LAIR
 

 **** FREE HARBOR

 		-- IF THE PLAYERS GO WITHOUT HELP

 			- The players will not make it to the leadership without something **VERY CREATIVE** 
 			- The outskirts will have minor skirmishes with Thugs and Slavers. These encounters can be avoided with sneak or deception.
 			- The main city will have larger battles with Thugs, Slavers, Captains, and some Assassins mixed in.  Sneak and Decption are difficult here.
 				~ Large fights will trigger alerts.
 			- If the group manages to go without being detected by any Slaver who is currently alive then the group may short rest uninterupted. Long rests are interupted.
 			- If the group is detected by any Slaver who is currently alive, short rests are heavily interrupted and Long rests are not possible.
 			- Escaping the city is easier than entering.

 		-- IF THE PLAYERS GO WITH THE HELP OF THE OLD GAURD

 			- The Old Gaurd lays out the plan for the group.
 			- Players must help the Old Gaurd take control of three major POI in the city.
 				- Watch Towers
 					~ Reduces alerts
 				- Sewers
 					~ Allows for moving throughout the city undetected and backup squads.
 				- Armory
 					~ Reduces the amount of armed patrols.
